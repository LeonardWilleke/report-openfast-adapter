%%%%% Abstract %%%%%

\begin{abstract}
    \noindent This is a slightly modified \LaTeX~clone of the Microsoft Word template supplied for the AE2223-I project. These instructions give you guidelines for preparing the scientific article. You can use this document as a template if you are using \LaTeX. Please note that you are free to use other formatting styles, as long as you are consistent in how you apply them throughout your text. The Scientific Article should not exceed 4000 words, excluding abstract, references, captions and appendices. The abstract should appear at the beginning of your paper and it should not exceed 250 words. It should be one paragraph long and it should be comprehensible on its own, separately from the rest of the article. It should concisely indicate the background, scientific gap, research question or purpose, method, main results and conclusions dealt with in the article. Do not cite references in the abstract. The abstract should be bold, indented 3 picas (1/2”) on each side (which is by default already the case).
\end{abstract}
