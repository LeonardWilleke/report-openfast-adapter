\section{Example cases}
\label{section:cases}

To drive the adapter development and test the software at its current state, two example cases were implemented. The OpenFAST simulation of a single wind turbine, namely the NREL 5MW model \cite{Jonkman:2009}, is coupled. The first case implements the coupling to a dummy fluid solver. While performing no realistic computations, the dummy is handy to get an insight into the different data structures, mesh setups, and mapping options. The second case couples OpenFAST to the CFD program OpenFOAM. It can be seen as a first proof-of-principle with a successful data exchange via preCICE. However, more work needs to be done to ensure a correct and robust simulation. Both cases are part of the repository on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/LeonardWilleke/openfast-adapter/tree/main/cases}}.

\subsection{Coupling OpenFAST with a dummy CFD solver}

The motivation for this case is to provide a simple and fast way to test different functionalities and gain insight, not to perform realistic simulations. OpenFAST computes a NREL 5MW turbine with a fixed rotor to avoid mesh problems on the moving blades. The fluid solver is implemented as a simple C++ script. It creates a mesh that can be used to map data from OpenFAST and write constant values back. The dummy does not perform any calculations. To perform the coupling, the script calls preCICE. This case allows to explore the mapping and data exchange in a minimal setup.

OpenFAST employs two internal meshes of the turbine surface with different vertices. Force data is stored on one mesh, while flow velocity is stored on another. Both meshes can be accessed by the C++ API. However, it is also possible to exchange both variables on the velocity mesh only and call an internal mapping function in OpenFAST to map the force data to the force mesh. Inspired by the coupling setup in \cite{Taschner:2022}, I want to access both meshes and use preCICE for the mapping. This results in the elaborous coupling scheme seen in Figure \ref{fig:openfast:coupling}. In total, three meshes are employed: The Fluid solver has one mesh \textit{Fluid-Mesh} used for both the force and velocity data while the Solid solver (OpenFAST) uses two meshes. \textit{Solid-Mesh-Velocity} is the velocity mesh of OpenFAST, on which the velocity data from the Fluid solver is mapped. \textit{Solid-Mesh-Force} is the force mesh of OpenFAST, from which force data is mapped back to the Fluid solver.

\subsection{Coupling OpenFAST with OpenFOAM}

The second example case implements the coupling of OpenFAST to the CFD tool OpenFOAM. It employs the same coupling scheme and mesh use as the previous case. However, the Fluid mesh is now more complex. The main obstacle for a successful coupling is 

Case cfd-turbine
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain the setup
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Couple OpenFAST to OpenFOAM
		\item The coupling scheme and mesh use is identical to the dummy
		\item Now we are dealing with a different mesh on the fluid solver
		\item Main obstacle: The OpenFOAM adapter is not designed to implement a coupling with a solver using the actuator line method. How to map between the line mesh in OpenFAST (Figure )\ref{fig:mesh:fast} and the volume mesh in OpenFOAM (Figure \ref{fig:mesh:foam})?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Explain how the current setup works
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define a cellSet inside the OpenFOAM domain (Figure \ref{fig:mesh:foam}) to which OpenFAST is coupled
		\item Write the rotor and tower data to this subdomain
		\item Read velocity data from this subdomain
		\item The mapping from line to volume and back is done by preCICE, but probably wrong
	\end{itemize}
	\item How should the turbine be represented in OpenFOAM?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Volume mesh / cellSet
		\item Surface mesh / patch
		\item ALM implementation (eg with turbinesFoam)\\
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
