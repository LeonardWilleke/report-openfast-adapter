\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

A first preCICE-OpenFAST adapter to couple the wind energy engineering tool to CFD solvers was presented in this work. The coupling of an OpenFAST simulation of a single wind turbine with a dummy solver and OpenFOAM was discussed. Although a proof of concept was achieved, showing that preCICE can be used for the coupling to OpenFOAM in principle, some challenging tasks remain. The coupling of OpenFAST to an arbitrary CFD solver was not discussed and poses more questions. This work may serve as a starting point. The presented preCICE-OpenFAST adapter has the potential to be developed into a viable open-source alternative for the coupling of OpenFAST to different CFD solvers.
