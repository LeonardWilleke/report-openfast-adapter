\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item First coupling of OpenFAST and preCICE was presented
	\item Coupling with a dummy solver and OpenFOAM was discussed
	\item Although a proof of concept was achieved, some challenging tasks remain to enable a full coupling to CFD solvers
	\item How to map between OpenFAST and an arbitrary CFD solver? Where to place the mapping and smearing algorithm for the ALM method?
	\item This work may serve as a starting point
	\item Has the potential to be developed into a viable open-source alternative for the coupling of OpenFAST to different CFD solvers
\end{itemize}
