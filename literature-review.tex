A recent advancement in the coupling of OpenFAST is the tool \textbf{AspFAST} \cite{Taschner:2022}. Developed at the Delf University of Technology and the weather forecasting company Whiffle, it connects OpenFAST to the closed-license Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code GRASP. 
As a binder code, AspFAST serves as an intermediary between the GPU-driven GRASP and the CPU-driven OpenFAST. It accesses OpenFAST through a C++ API, essentially operating as a driver code. GRASP is accessed through a specialized API that handles the transition from CPU to GPU operations.
The core functionalities of AspFAST include the data exchange and mapping between GRASP and OpenFAST. This is done for crucial data such as force, velocity, and the position of turbine blades. Notably, the code implements the mapping between the volume-based velocity grid of GRASP and the actuator line model of OpenFAST. Because the coupling  code\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/whiffle-public/aspfast} (visited on 20.12.2023)} is open-source, it can serve as a blueprint for anyone interested in coupling OpenFAST via the C++ interface.
The software architecture of AspFAST is not far from our idea for the preCICE-OpenFAST adapter: AspFAST is a plug-in for the CFD solver GRASP while being the driver code for OpenFAST, serving as the "adapter" between the two. A big difference lies in the fact that AspFAST also has to implement the mapping algorithms, which are executed by preCICE in our approach.

The \textbf{ExaWind} project \cite{Sprague:2019} is based on the open-source, massively paralles and incompressible flow solver NaluWind \cite{Ananthan:2019}. It is a wind-focused adaption of the general flow solver NaluCFD and strives to deliver flow simulations in exascale. Hence, great emphasis lies on the scalability and simulation speed of the software through advanced solver and coupling algorihtms as well as the use of GPUs. The coupling to OpenFAST is implemented inside NaluWind and not as additional plug-in. An extensive documentation with insights into the theory and verification is given. 

Another coupling based on solver modification is the Simulator for Wind Farm Applications or \textbf{SOWFA} \cite{Churchfield:2012} from NREL. It couples OpenFOAM to OpenFAST by providing an additional  class \textit{horizontalAxisALM} in OpenFOAM. It defines functions to call OpenFAST and enables the data exchange. This class can be included directly in any OpenFOAM solver by modifying the OpenFOAM source code, so that the solver calls OpenFAST during each time step.

A software solution relying on a similar coupling tool to preCICE is \textbf{foamFAST} \cite{Weber:2017}. This project uses the commercial coupling tool for partitioned multi-physics simulations MpCCI, developed and sold by the Fraunhofer SCAI. Similar to preCICE, MpCCI is connected to different programs via adapters. Once the adapter is written, you can couple your tool to any other tool in the MpCCI environment. A difference in software architecture is the fact that MpCCI acts as the master algorithm: It calls the solvers instead of being called by them like preCICE. During the project, a MpCCI adapter for OpenFAST was developed and an existing OpenFOAM adapter modified to perform the coupling between the two.\\

The reviewed literature shows two different approaches on how to undertake the coupling. The first approach is to \textbf{modify the CFD solver source code}, as the ExaWind project has done with the NaluWind solver and SOWFA with OpenFOAM. While convenient for developers who are familiar with the software, this approach can prove hard to maintain when the underlying solver software is updated.

The second approach leaves the CFD solvers intact and uses \textbf{plug-ins or master algorithms} to connect the software tools. The plug-in approach achieves the coupling via an additional module or library that can be called by the original CFD solver. An example is AspFAST, where the stand-alone plug-in code is maintained seperately from the solver. foamFAST implements a master algorithm and is especially interesting because the coupling tool MpCCI it relies on is similar to preCICE.

Given the previous work, why should we continue to develop a preCICE-OpenFAST adapter?
Our approach combines some of the positive aspects of previous projects. First, using preCICE allows to rely on advanced and tested coupling algorithms without the need to re-implement them or buy a licensed software. Establishing a preCICE-OpenFAST adapter opens up the road to connect OpenFAST not only to OpenFOAM, but to any CFD solver coupled to preCICE. Furthermore, preCICE creates a clean and easy to use simulation environment and simplifies setting up and maintaining simulations.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that OpenFOAM is currently the only CFD solver connected to preCICE which can be used for a coupling with OpenFAST. Coupling any other tool, such as the presented GRASP or NaluCFD, will require the development of additional adapters.

What are some serious drawbacks?
\begin{itemize}
\item There are currently no preCICE adapters for other CFD solvers that would be interesting to couple to: NaluWind, GRASP, ...
\item Developing such adapters would mean to re-implement a functionality that already exists in native coupling tools --> questionable if that is a good investment
\end{itemize}
