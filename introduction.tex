\section{Introduction}

\lettrine{T}{his} document is a template for the \LaTeX version of the AE2223-I Scientific Article. A Microsoft Word template can be found on Brightspace under “Scientific Writing” on the AE2223-I page, under “Lecture schedule and scientific article template”. Please note that the Word-document is essentially the guiding template, this is merely a \LaTeX~clone with the same information. You are free to use other formatting styles, as long as you are consistent in your formatting.

In the introduction of your article you describe the state-of-the-art in your field of research. Refer to the relevant sources of literature. Identify a so-called scientific gap or research gap, clarify your research question and describe what your research adds to the current state of knowledge. Use the literature review you have written at the start of this project to your advantage.
