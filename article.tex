%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
    \noindent  
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Flow dynamics in wind parks are important for many engineering problems from optimized control to load reduction
    	\item High-fidelity flow computation, eg in OpenFOAM, is desirable to understand the farm flow dynamic
    	\item Low-fidelity simulation of the wind turbines is often sufficient
    	\item OpenFAST allows to simulate one or multiple turbines in low fidelity
    	\item I present a preCICE-OpenFAST adapter to couple OpenFAST to the coupling library preCICE
    	\item preCICE couples simulation programs in a black-box manner to achieve multi-´physics simulations
    	\item The adapter serves as driver code for OpenFAST to steer the simulation and calls preCICE for the data exchange
    	\item As a first proof of concept, a coupling to OpenFOAM with limited capabilities is presented
    \end{itemize}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful to Prof. Axelle Viré who accepted me as a visiting researcher and made this work possible. Many thanks to her and Evert Ewald for the discussions and hints during our meetings. Extended thanks to Benjamin Uekermann, who enabled my visit at TU Delft in the first place and provided feedback along the way. Lastly, I want to thank the wonderful crowd of PhD researchers in the wind energy department who made my time in Delft memorable.
