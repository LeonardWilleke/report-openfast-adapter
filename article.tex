%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    Flow dynamics in wind parks are important for many engineering problems, ranging from optimized control to load reduction. This work introduces a preCICE-OpenFAST adapter designed to seamlessly couple OpenFAST with the preCICE library. preCICE facilitates the black-box coupling of simulation programs, enabling multi-physics simulations. The adapter acts as a driver code for OpenFAST, steering the turbine simulation and utilizing preCICE for efficient data exchange with the flow simulation. In a proof of concept, the adapter is employed to couple OpenFAST with OpenFOAM, demonstrating its potential despite limited capabilities. The presented approach lays the foundation for more comprehensive wind park simulations by integrating OpenFAST in the preCICE ecosystem. This research contributes to advancing wind park modeling techniques, providing a framework for studying complex interactions within wind farms.
